# Diamonds  Project
 
Whether it's a rare book or a diamond, something rare and unique is often expensive.

In this project,I analyzed the data of various features of 54,000 round-cut diamonds to examine what features affect the price of diamonds most.

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the price of a diamond and its carat weight, with modifying effects from the cut, color, and clarity grades given to the diamond.
I found a somewhat surprising result initially when the marginal trend for the cut, color, and clarity variables indicated that higher diamond quality was associated with lower price. However, higher diamond quality was also associated with smaller diamonds. When I isolated diamonds of a single carat weight, there was a clear positive relationship between higher diamond quality and higher diamond price.
I also verified the relationship between diamond carat weight and its x, y, and z dimensions. For the dataset given,there was an interesting interaction in the categorical diamond quality features. The lower clarity grades looked like they had slightly better distribution of cut and color grades than diamonds with the higher clarity grades.
